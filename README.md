# Mosquito_Project
Project for Code Louisville

Basic project consisting of an image that can change based on a button being clicked, limited talk about mosquitos and a lot of garbled text, and a newsletter registration form that doesn't connect to anywhere. The purpose of the project is to hit the requirements needed to pass for the Code Louisville program and have a bit of goofy fun.
